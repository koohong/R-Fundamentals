# Writing and Running Code

```{r}
# ctrl + alt + i  : code chunk

# Inside code chunks, text lines need to be started with a # (hashtag)

# You can use R like a giant calculator! 
2 + 3
```

💡 **Tip:** Writing **comments** about your code is very important. The best practice is to write **why** you are doing something, not just **what** you are doing.

### 🥊 Challenge 1: Create and Run a Chunk of Code

Use the two methods above to create a chunk of code. In the chunk, experiment with writing and running some math. Remember to comment your code.

💡 **Tip:** You can save this notebook with your answers to the challenges and any notes you take throughout the workshop. Click the 💾 icon in the toolbar or select File --\> Save.

## Why use R?

R is a programming language designed for **data analysis**. R is great for data cleaning, data visualization, and statistical analysis, among other things.

R is **not** a general purpose programming language. If you want to do something like build a website or train a machine learning model, languages such as [Python](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Fundamentals-Pilot) are better suited for these tasks.

🔔 **Question:** What tasks would you like to use R for? How do you envision using R in your research or class projects? **Put your answer in the chat.**

## Creating Variables

Variables are objects that hold values. Variables can be inside data sets (like columns in an excel sheet) or standalone objects. The syntax for creating a variable is:

-   Left hand side is the variable name.

-   Next is the **assignment** **operator**: `<-`

-   Right hand side is the value to assign to that variable.

```{r}
# a variable that gives the year 
year <- 2023

# print out the value
year
```

We can read the above code as "create a variable called year and assign to it the value 2023".

Variables can hold different types of values.

```{r}
# assign a numeric value to the variable year
year <- 2023

# assign a character value to the variable country
country <- "Mexico"

# assign a numeric value to the variable lifeexp
lifeexp <- 76.2

```

⚠️ **Warning**: We will talk about different types of variables (numeric, characters, categorical) in Part 2.

### 🥊 Challenge 2: Creating Variables

Create a variable called `continent` and assign it the value "Americas". Create a variable called `pop` and assign it the value 4.5.

```{r}



```

All variables created show up in the Global Environment (top right panel).

```{r}
# print a list of all variables in your environment
ls()
```

You can remove variables from the global environment.

```{r}

# remove a single variable
rm(year)

# remove all variables in the global environment
rm(list = ls())
```

⚠️ **Warning**: You cannot undo removing a variable. You must instead re-create the variable.

If you want to rename a variable, the easiest thing to do is create a variable with the new name and remove the old variable.

```{r}
# variable storing the population of Mexico
pop <- 126

# rename to be more informative
pop_millions <- pop

# print it to confirm that it holds the value of pop
pop_millions

# remove the old variable
rm(pop)

# print out a list of current variables
ls()
```

💡 **Tip:** `ls()` and `rm()` are both **functions**, which are commands that generate some output. We will learn several functions across the workshop. The best way to learn and remember functions in R is to Google them or ask ChatGPT!

### 🥊 Challenge 3: Creating Variables from Other Variables

Pick a country. Look up its population and create a variable which stores the population. Now look up the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and create another variable which stores the GDP.

Can you use these two variables to create a third variable which stores the GDP per capita (GDP divided by population)?

```{r}



```

## Creating Vectors

Most of the time, we want to store multiple values. For example, I might want to record the population in Mexico from 2018 to 2022. **Vectors** can store multiple values as long as they're the same type (all numeric, all characters etc).

To create a vector, you use the `c()` function, which stands for concatenate (meaning combine).

```{r}
# create a vector with the approx population of Mexico for 5 years  
c(123, 124, 125, 126, 127)

# as chance would have it, Mexico's population has increased by about 1 million each year from 2018 to 2022
```

Vectors are assigned to variables using the same assignment operator (\<-) that we used for single value variables.

```{r}
# save the population counts to a vector
pop_mexico <- c(123, 124, 125, 126, 127)
pop_mexico
```

If we do something to the values in a vector, R applies that operation to each item in the vector.

```{r}
# multiple the values in pop_mexico by 1 million
pop_mexico*1000000

# you forgot to count 2 million people - add them to our counts
pop_mexico + 2
```

## 🎬 **Demo**: Next Time...

Most of the time, you won't be working with single value variables or vectors. Instead, you'll be working with data that contains multiple variables. In Part 2, we will learn how to read in data to R and create **data frames** (a way to store data with multiple rows and columns).

🔔 **Tip:** Run the two chunks of code below. What do you think we are doing?

```{r}
# read in data
gap <- read.csv(file = "../data/gapminder.csv")
head(gap)

```

```{r}
# subset data
gap[gap$country == "Mexico", c("country", "year", "pop")] 


```

## Key Points

-   In RStudio you can write code in an **R Notebook** or an **R Script** - we are using a notebook

-   Use the syntax **variable \<- value** to create a variable and assign it a value

-   Vectors store multiple values as long as they're the same type

-   We used the following functions: `ls()`, `rm()`, and `c()`. To see how to use them use **?** followed by the function name (or Google them)
